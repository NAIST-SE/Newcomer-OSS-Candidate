## NewcomerCandidate: Characterizing Contributions of a Novice Developers

### ABSTRACT

The ability of an Open Source Software (OSS) project to attract, onboard, and retain any newcomer is vital to its livelihood. Evidence suggests that there is an upsurge in novice developers joining social coding platforms such as GitHub. However, the extent to which these developers contribute to OSS projects is unknown. We execute the protocols of a registered report to study the activities of a  Newcomer OSS-Candidate, who is a novice developer that is new to social coding platform with the intention to onboard an OSS project. We use GitHub as a case platform, analyzing 171 identified Newcomer OSS-Candidates to characterize their GitHub activities in terms of the repositories, contributions, and onboarding. Results show that newcomers are likely to target software based repositories, i.e., 66%. We observe that their first contributions are mainly associated with development activities (commits) and maintenance activities (PRs). Results also show that Newcomer OSS-Candidates are less likely to practice social coding in terms of multiple authorship in their first contributions. Our results indicate that Newcomer OSS-Candidates do end up onboarding (i.e., 30% quantitative, 70% follow-up survey), confirming that finding a way to start is the most challenging barrier. The work provides evidence that novice developers to social coding platforms like GitHub have potential to onboard and contribute to OSS projects.
